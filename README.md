# Image Processing Tool in C

A command-line image processing program written in **C (C99)** that loads, processes, and saves images using a custom text-based RGB image format.  
The project demonstrates **low-level systems programming**, **manual memory management**, and **classical image processing techniques**.

## Features

- Custom image file parsing (ASCII RGB format)
- Dynamic memory management for arbitrary image sizes
- Grayscale (monochrome) conversion using perceptual weighting
- Pixel intensity histogram computation
- Batch processing of multiple images in one execution
- Robust error handling for file I/O and memory allocation
